# Weak Event .NET

# Weak Event pattern implementation.

Did you hear about **[Event Aggregator](http://www.google.com/search?q=Event+Aggregator+Pattern)**?

Have you tried it out?<br/>
Yeah... They are mostly messy, greasy, excessive. Sorry I'm cheating. They are wonderful, just don't fire me.

* [Prism Event Aggregator](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921122.aspx)
* [StoryTeller](http://storyteller.tigris.org)

But how about the old plain .NET Framework **events**?<br/>
Now the **Weak Events**.

How it works:
1. Add reference (.dll-file) to your project from the **[Weak Delegate Project](https://github.com/it3xl/WeakDelegate)**.
1. Use the [Custom Event Accessors](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb882534.aspx) for your events.
1. Or see an example here - [MyClassWithWeakEvent.cs](https://github.com/it3xl/WeakEvent/blob/master/Weak%20Event%20Solution/WeakEventProject/MyClassWithWeakEvent.cs)
